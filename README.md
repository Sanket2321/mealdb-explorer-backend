# mealdb-explorer-backend

MealDB Explorer Backend is a simple Spring Boot REST API that integrates with TheMealDB using the free test API key `1`. It includes in-memory caching with expiry, follows REST guidelines, and runs fully locally using `mvn spring-boot:run` on `http://localhost:8080`. It provides endpoints for searching meals, fetching meal details, categories, areas, and random meals through clean and consistent JSON responses.
